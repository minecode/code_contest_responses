Here's a "line block" (note how whitespace is honored):

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

![example image](example-image.jpg "An exemplary image")

Inline math equation: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line like so:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
